1. Offerings are unique. In other words, multiple offerings on the same day and time slot must be offered at a different location.

context Offering
inv:
  Offering.allInstances()->forAll(o1, o2 |
    o1 <> o2 and
    o1.date = o2.date and
    o1.startTime = o2.startTime and
    o1.endTime = o2.endTime
    implies
    o1.location <> o2.location
  )


2. Any client who is underage must necessarily be accompanied by an adult who acts as their guardian.

context Client
inv:
  self.age >= 18 or self.guardianName->notEmpty()

3. The city associated with an offering must be one of the cities that the instructor has indicated in their availabilities.

context Offering
inv:
  if (self.status = 'Taken') then
    (self.instructor.cities->includes(self.location))
  endif

4. A client does not have multiple bookings on the same day and time slot.

context Client
inv:
  self.bookings->isUnique(b | b.offering.date, b.offering.startTime, b.offering.endTime)
